# austere
a default browser switcher based on material conditions &amp; contexts

## rationale

if you're anything like me you play some cpu/gpu heavy games but still like to pretend it's the future where you can run a browser and a game at the same time. you also probably have a really tab-populated workhorse browser and maybe a browser for personal stuff.

austere lets you choose what browser should launch when your system is under load.

## usage

before you can use austere as your smart default browser you need to configure the lightweight browser you'd like it to run. just call `austere.py` without any arguments to get a configuration prompt. once you've configured your lightweight browser you're ready to get smart!
